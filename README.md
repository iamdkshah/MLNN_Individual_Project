# MLNN_Individual_Project
A deep learning project for brain tumour detection using CNNs and Grad-CAM
# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to classify brain MRI images into four categories: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **pituitary tumor**, and **no tumor**. The best-performing model (EfficientNetB0) is fine-tuned, and Grad-CAM is used to interpret the model's predictions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect brain tumors in MRI images using deep learning. The project compares multiple CNN architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB0) and fine-tunes the best-performing model. Grad-CAM is used to visualize the regions of the MRI images that the model focuses on when making predictions.
